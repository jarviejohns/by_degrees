Hello! 

This is my space to noodle lessons learnt, challenges identified and how were they solved. As an engineer, technological advances always fascinate me. As a computer scientist, I am like a child trying to question the inner workings of things around us. As a data scientist, I use the skills I have gathered (and continue to gather) in analyzing these unique challenges, solving them and improving existing solutions. As a simple human being in this vast universe, I "stand on the shoulders of giants" to find, understand and learn the basic truths (laws) that governs anything and everything infinitesimal to infinite. After all, even if we do not realize it, we are all travellers through space and time.
